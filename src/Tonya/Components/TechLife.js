          Currently I am a Software Engineer at Stats Perform in Chicago.  I started off building front-end web applications; mostly using Reactjs.
          Today's workflow consist of backend development, infrastructure, database, and cloud computing.

          My journey into technology all started at a non-profit organization called i.c.stars.  Their focus is creating leaders in business and technology.  During my internship I meet a lot of people.  One of the most motivating things that I experienced was the women who were advocating for women in tech and other engineering that are men dominated.  It was an empowering experience that boosted my confidence and eased my fear of failing

          I love the sense of accomplishment when I working with code.  My journey into technology was not the easiest.  It took me thru my most challenging experiences and headaches.  It took so much dedication and determination to keep my focus on my goals.  Now I have a reimagined future.
